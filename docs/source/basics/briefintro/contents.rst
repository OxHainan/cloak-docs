What is Cloak?
==============

Cloak a pluggable and configurable framework for developing 
and deploying confidential smart contracts. The key capability 
of Cloak is to allow developers to implement and deploy 
practical solutions to *multi-party transaction* (MPT) problems, 
i.e., to transact with secret inputs and states owned by different 
parties, by simply *specifying* it. 
To this end, Cloak allows users to specify privacy invariants in a 
declarative way, automatically generate runtime with verifiably 
enforced privacy and deploy it to the existing platforms 
with TEE-Blockchain architecture, enabling the MPT. 

Additionally, we identify the pitfalls in achieving MPT, and provide 
the treat, i.e., non-deterministic negotiation and fair 
publication of MPT results. In our evaluation on both 
examples and real-world applications, developers manage 
to deploy business services on blockchain in a concise 
manner by only developing Cloak smart contracts, whose 
size is less than 30% of the deployed ones, and the gas cost 
of deployed MPTs reduced by 19%. 

Cloak is an ongoing project aimting to become a chain-agnostic 
privacy infrasturcture of the blockchain ecology. We are always calling for
talented, self-motivated developers, reserachers or students
who are excited about our vision. Let us make it together.
