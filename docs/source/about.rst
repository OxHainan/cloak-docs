Oxford-Hainan Blockchain Research Institute (OxHainan) is closely 
associated with the University College Oxford Blockchain Research Centre 
and is strategically located in China's first officially 
licensed Blockchain Pilot Site, within the Hainan Free Trade Zone.

The Institute primarily focuses on the research and 
development of technology and products that support the 
concept of digital civilization constructed based on blockchain. 
OxHainan's main research areas include blockchain infrastructure, 
consensus algorithms, digital identity, cryptographic protocols, 
information security engineering, privacy protection, code security 
detection, formal verification, regulatory sandboxes, game theory, 
etc. The Institute will build an innovational application platform, 
talent development programme, a startup incubator, 
and a training centre geared towards comprehensive 
blockchain education. The institute aims to move blockchain 
to the mainstream and to cultivate a new generation of digital 
economy technologies.

Cloak Team
--------------------------------------------

The Cloak Team is an R&D team of OxHainan for privacy protection on the blockchain. 
We strive to develop disruptive new frameworks for improving security, 
privacy, and trustworthiness in blockchain data processing in various settings, 
efficiently and at scale. In the last years, we have had a particular focus on the 
following topics: novel methods and tools for blockchain privacy, as well as efficient 
techniques for secure, verifiable privacy-preserved computation, especially TEE-based solutions.

We are developing methods and tools, such as Cloak, to enable the verifiable and 
privacy-friendly processing of blockchain data. Welcome to join us. 
Let's make it together to empower all blockchain-driven ecosystems 
and applications and towards a promising self-sovereign, 
transparent, and fair cooperation future.
