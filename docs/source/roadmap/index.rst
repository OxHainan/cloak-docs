- **Silk Weaving**
   .. note:: 
      *"Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of 
      yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth,
      which was known in all the great civilisations, but no clear line of 
      causality has been established."*

   - support main features and structures of Solidity in Language.
   - construct user-friendly toolchains and API to support both academic and industrial usage
   - adapt and plugin the Cloak to enable MPT on the Ethereum

- **Silk Road**
   .. note:: 
      *"The Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative trade in silk 
      that was carried out along its length beginning during the Han dynasty 
      in China. It was and is a network of trade routes connecting the 
      East and West."*

   - implement non-derterministic MPT negotiation protocol
   - achieve fair MPT results distribution
   - support a wide range of blockchain adaptations, e.g., Ethereum, etc.

   .. note:: 
      *"The Invisibility Cloak endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, 
      no matter what spells are cast at it."* --  Xenophilius Lovegood

   - support general-purpose privacy-preserved computation, e.g., AI training.
   - provision a continuously operating decentralized Cloak Network
