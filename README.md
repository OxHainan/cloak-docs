## What is Cloak?

Cloak is a pluggable and configurable framework for developing and deploying confidential smart contracts. 
To this end, Cloak allows users to specify *privacy invariants*
(what is private data and to who is the data private) in a 
declarative way. Then, it automatically generate runtime with verifiably 
enforced privacy and deploy it to the existing EVM-enabled platforms 
(*e.g.*, Ethereum) and TEE devices to enable the confidential smart 
contract. 


Cloak is designed to work with TEE and EVM-enabled blockchain. 
It initializes the blockchain in a pluggable manner to become a new architecture, where the blockchain and its clients are enhanced to be the Cloak Blockchain and the Cloak Client respectively, and the Cloak Network is added by Cloak.

In [**Cloak Networks**][cloak-networks], all nodes run the same application inside an enclave.
The user sends confidential transactions or multi-party transactions to the network. 
A consortium of members sending governance transactions in charge of governing the network. 
The effects of user and member transactions are eventually committed to a replicated encrypted ledger.
